# World-Vaccination-Rates---Linear-Regression

# PURPOSE:
COVID vaccination rates vary a great deal between countries. There are various factors to account for in the differences in vaccination rates amongst countries worldwide. The determing factors are economics (richer countries tend to have higher rates) and demographics (countries prioritize recipients by age). The goal of this project is to use linear regression to model the vaccination rates in different countries in terms of their GDP (a measure of economic output) and demographics.

# BACKGROUND:
The following project uses the R language and RStudio environment. It uses three datasets: time_series_covid19_vaccine_doses_admin_global.csv (contains the number of vaccine doses given every day in different countries), API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_3011433.csv (contains the GDP of different countries in different years), and demographics.csv (gives the proportion of a countryâ€™s population in different age groups and some other demographic data such as mortality rates and expected lifetime). 

# STRUCTURE:
There are two major components that had to be completed prior to further analyzing and deducing the data to find the worldwide vaccination rates. Data tidying/wrangling and linear modeling are the two foundational steps in this project (and across the board for other data science projects). 

Data tidying/wrangling is the process of cleaning up data(sets) by either removing and/or rearranging data to best fit the objectives of the project. Each of the three datasets had to undergo this process to ensure concise and proper preparation for the linear modeling aspect of the project. Upon finishing this process, ..... (will finish this part when linear modeling is done .. ).
